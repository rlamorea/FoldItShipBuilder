## Size and Space - A Starship's Dimensions

A designâ€™s `Size` is relative to other designs in the same category.  Size is an abstraction used to calculate 
the `Space` available to components in the starship.

Size and Space uses the chosen size to determine the attributes:

* *Space* - a relative unit of space for a category.  Most components are specified in terms of the space they take up.
* *Fixed Space* - a fixed unit of space.  Some components are specified by the fixed space they take up.

### Design Choices

#### Size Ranges

The following table lists the range of possible sizes based on the `Category` of your design.
