## Classifying the Design

The classification of your design provides a basic idea of its size and capabilities.

### Design Choices

#### Category

The category of a design broadly indicates its size and capabilities.  Starships in smaller categories are 
compact and do more with less.  Larger categories mean more space to provide access and redundancy to 
important components.

#### Type

The type of a design defines its function.  The type can be pretty much whatever you’d like it to be.  
The following table shows some suggested types for each category.

* **Craft** - Fighter, Attack Craft, Scout, Shuttle
* **Ship** - Corvette, Courier Ship, Frigate
* **Capital Ship** - Destroyer, Cargo Ship, Liner, Cruiser, Battleship
* **Supership** - System Assault Ship, Superliner, Supercarrier, Starbase
* **Megaship** - Colony Ship, Space City

#### Class

The class of a design is a unique (or mostly so) identifier for the design.  
It can be whatever you’d like.  Some examples:

* Aurora-class Starfury Fighter (Craft)
* YT1300-class Small Bulk Freighter (Ship)
* Constitution-class Heavy Cruiser (Capital Ship)
* Imperial-class Star Destroyer (Supership)
