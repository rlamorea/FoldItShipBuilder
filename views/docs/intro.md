# Getting Started with FIGURE for Starships

FIGURE is the _Fold-It Game Unit Requirements Engine_.  It is documentation and construction "sheet"
combined into one, with all the calculation and rules arcana taken care of for you.

All that's left is to making your design choices and watch out for design errors.  

The validity of your design is tracked from start to finish.  When your design is invalid there will 
be numerous indicators of what choices are the source of the problem, and the accompanying documentation 
should also provide clues of where you've gone wrong.

When your design is complete, you will have everything you need to put your Starship into action
in any FoldIt game.

## Design Steps

Design creation is done in a series of steps.  At each step you will make some `Design` Choices.  
These, in turn, will generate the `Attribute`s for the step.  Design choices often have Restrictions 
placed on them.  If a choice is made that does not conform to these restrictions, the design will become Invalid.  
A design may also become invalid due to an overrun of a `Resource` or a failure to meet a Resource Requirement.
  
1. **[Classification](#classification)** - choose the `Category`, `Type`, and `Class` of the starship.
1. **[Technology](#technology)** - choose the `Technology Level` (TL) and tracks that apply to the design.
1. **[Size and Space](#size-and-space)** - choose the desired `Size` of the design.
1. **Size Allocation** - allocate size to the major design components.
1. **Structure** - specify the design’s internal structure.
1. **Propulsion** - specify the design’s stellar and interstellar propulsion components.
1. **Mission** - specify the design’s mission-specific components, including armament.
1. **Systems** - specify the communications, sensors, databases, and other systems for the design.
1. **Control** - specify the methods of control of the design, such as command stations and computers.
1. **Habitation** - specify the design’s crew accommodations, life support, access and escape.
1. **Capacity** - specify the designs’ fuel, ammunition and stores.
1. **Power** - specify the power generation, storage, and distribution of the design.
1. **Shell** - specify the outer covering and/or armor of the design.
1. **Materials and Engineering** - specify special aspects of the design.
1. **Completion** - complete the design.
