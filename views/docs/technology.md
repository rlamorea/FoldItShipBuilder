## The Technology of the Design

The technology of a starship determines what components may be available to it, and the capabilities of 
those components.  Technology is split into “levels” from 1 to 10.  Starships are only available from 
`Technology Level` (TL) 5 and up.

In addition to technology level, a design may take advantage of `Technology Track`s, which are forms of 
advanced (sometimes “impossible”) technologies.  Technology tracks are often defined by the `Universe` 
the design is targeted to.

### Design Choices

#### Technology Level

The technology level of a design is used to determine the availability and capability of the components it will use.  
Starships (actually spaceships) are not feasible until Technology Level 5.  Designs with a Supership or Megaship `Category` 
must have a Technology Level of 7 or higher.

#### Technology Tracks

The technology tracks for a design specify sets of special “sci-fi” technologies.  Some, or all, of these technologies 
are defined by the universe the design will operate in.  Starship components may require a technology track in order 
to be included in the design.  A design must have a TL equal to or higher than the “Minimum TL” of the technology 
track to include it.

A design can specify one technology track as a “prototype” to use it at a TL one less than the “Minimum TL” of the 
track.  Components that require this technology track will use significantly higher power, fuel, and other resources, 
and be prohibitively expensive.
