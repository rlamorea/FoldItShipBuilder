Design Notes:
-------------

"Intro" docs are spread throughout the form -- these can be dismissed individually.
Once dismissed, they will remain hidden unless the user expands "Intros" again.
Expanding intros can be done as "show all", or "reveal" -- in the latter case a
small floating expander will show up where any intro doc section is and this can be
expanded or collapsed.

Rules docs are displayed
